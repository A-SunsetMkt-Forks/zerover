## Qualifications

[ZeroVer](https://zerover.org)'s patent-pending zero-based versioning
scheme can obviously be used by everyone, but not every usage is
necessarily notable. Check that the first and at least one other
criterion apply:

- [ ] A current ZeroVer-compliant version (`0.*`) or long history of ZeroVer usage, and
- [ ] Very wide exposure (i.e., 1,000+ GitHub stars), or
- [ ] Active promotion as part of a paid product or service (e.g., Hashicorp Vault), or
- [ ] Relative maturity and infrastructural importance (e.g., Compiz, docutils)

## Basic info

**Project name**:
**Project link**:

## Additional notability info

*(Prominent uses or users, or promotional material, ideally written
for an audience not familiar with that project's particular
technologies)*

## One more thing

Since you've made it this far, why not file [a PR](https://github.com/mahmoud/zerover/pulls)?

If your suggestion is a GitHub project, it's as easy as adding two
lines to the `projects.yaml` file. Here's [an edit
link](https://github.com/mahmoud/zerover/edit/master/projects.yaml).

No pressure or anything, feel free to smack that submit button, too! Thanks again!
