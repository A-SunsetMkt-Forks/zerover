ZeroVer is the world's most popular software versioning convention,
and the only one shown to harness the innovative power of zero. The
benefits are innumerable and the effects on the software world are
profound.

Version 0.0.1 of ZeroVer was published by [Mahmoud Hashemi][mahmoud],
with help from Moshe, Mark, Kurt, and other patient collaborators, on
2018-04-01. April Fool's Day. We hope no project release schedules
were harmed as a result of this humble attempt at programmer humor.

# Real talk

Software is hard. Versioning is nuanced. Creative projects
rarely obey strict schedules.

But, if your project has made the ZeroVer list, it definitely meets
consensus criteria for having a public release. Here are some of the
recommended guidelines:

* [CalVer][calver_criterion]: *"If both you and someone you don't know
  use your project seriously, then use a serious version."*
* [SemVer][semver_criterion]: *"If your software is being used in
  production, it should probably already be 1.0.0."*

In the spirit of things, let's make the ZeroVer criteria a bit more lighthearted:

* ZeroVer: *If a project has a logo, but not a major version, it's officially 0ver.*

For additional ZeroVer criteria, check out the submission template.

# What to do

[0ver.org][0ver] may list some auspicious names, but it's not a very good
look. If you're having trouble picking a version, or are stuck
asymptotically approaching an "actual" release, do yourself a favor
and slap a CalVer on it. [You'll be in much better company][calver_users].
