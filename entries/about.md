ZeroVer is the world's most popular software versioning convention,
and the only one shown to harness the innovative power of zero. The
benefits are innumerable and the effects on the software world are
profound.

Version 0.0.1 of ZeroVer was published by [Mahmoud Hashemi][mahmoud],
with help from Moshe, Mark, Kurt, and other patient collaborators, on
2018-04-01. ZeroVer is satire, [please do not use it][poes]. We
sincerely hope no project release schedules were harmed as a result
of this humble attempt at programmer humor.

# Real talk

Software is hard. Versioning is nuanced. Creative projects rarely obey
strict schedules. There are many reasons why software gets left in
prerelease mode. But there's no shortage of yak to shave.

If your project has made the ZeroVer list, it definitely meets
consensus criteria for having a public release. You've built something
useful and great, and continuing to advertise prerelease status hurts
adoption, especially for adopters trying to convince others that your
software is as dependable as practice shows.

Here are recommended guidelines from two of the most popular
versioning schemes:

* [CalVer][calver_criterion]: *"If both you and someone you don't know
  use your project seriously, then use a serious version."*
* [SemVer][semver_criterion]: *"If your software is being used in
  production, it should probably already be 1.0.0."*

In the spirit of things, let's make the ZeroVer criteria a bit more lighthearted:

* **ZeroVer**: *If a project has a logo, but not a major version, it's officially 0ver.*

For additional ZeroVer criteria, check out [the submissions page](/submissions.html).

# What to do

[0ver.org][0ver] may list some auspicious names, but it's not a very
good look. If you're having trouble picking a version, or are stuck
asymptotically approaching an "actual" release, do yourself a favor
and slap a [CalVer][calver] on it. [You'll be in much better
company][calver_users].
