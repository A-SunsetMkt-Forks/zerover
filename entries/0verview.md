title: 0-based Versioning
publish_date: March 3, 2018

Pretty much every project in the open-source world agrees: **Major
versions are for suckers**. The best versions are like arrays:
0-based.

List of popular projects using this scheme: cython, docutils, datadog,
werkzeug, flask, etc. toml call-out for hypocrisy. OpenSSL gets an
honorable mention for staying on v0 until 2015. scipy same, for 16
years. They lost their nerve and will be sorely missed. These projects
prove you can't rush perfection (but you can certainly delay it)
(more: dash, inkscape, pandas, wheel, ...)

TODO: links, initial release, number of releases, etc.

   Project           |  Initial release | Number of releases |  Current version
